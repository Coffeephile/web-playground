# Web Playground

WebPlayground is like CodePen but for your localhost. It scaffolds just one HTML, one JavaScript and one CSS file for you, then open a browser with live reloading. Optionally, you can update `playground.yml` to enable builtin preprocessors or add external scripts.

## Give it a try by:

```sh
npm install -g web-playground

# Scaffold current directory by running
# This will generate playground.yml, html.html, javascript.js and css.css
# in current directory
wpg

# Run `wpg` again to see your page in browser
wpg
```
